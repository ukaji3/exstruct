# ExStruct Benchmark

This benchmark compares methods for answering questions about Excel documents using GPT-4o:

- exstruct
- openpyxl
- pdf (xlsx->pdf->text)
- html (xlsx->html->table text)
- image_vlm (xlsx->pdf->png -> GPT-4o vision)

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- LibreOffice (`soffice` in PATH)
- OPENAI_API_KEY in `.env`

## Setup

```bash
cd benchmark
cp .env.example .env
pip install -e ..  # install exstruct from repo root
pip install -e .
```

## Run

```bash
make all
```

Outputs:

- outputs/extracted/\* : extracted context (text or images)
- outputs/prompts/\*.jsonl
- outputs/responses/\*.jsonl
- outputs/results/results.csv
- outputs/results/report.md

## How to interpret results (public guide)

This benchmark reports two evaluation tracks to keep comparisons fair:

- Exact: strict string match with no normalization.
- Normalized: applies case-specific rules in `data/normalization_rules.json` to
  absorb formatting differences (aliases, split/composite labels).

Recommended interpretation:

- Use **Exact** to compare end-to-end string fidelity (best for literal extraction).
- Use **Normalized** to compare **document understanding** across methods.
- When methods disagree between tracks, favor Normalized for Excel-heavy layouts
  where labels are split/merged or phrased differently.
- Always cite both accuracy and cost metrics when presenting results publicly.

## Evaluation

The evaluator now writes two tracks:

- Exact: `score`, `score_ordered` (strict string match, current behavior)
- Normalized: `score_norm`, `score_norm_ordered` (applies case-specific rules)

Normalization rules live in `data/normalization_rules.json` and are applied in
`bench.cli eval`. Publish these rules alongside the benchmark to keep the
normalized track transparent and reproducible.
