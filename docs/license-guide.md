## Purpose of This Document

This document is intended to help **corporate users**—including legal teams, IT departments, compliance officers, and internal developers—understand the licensing implications of using **exstruct** within:

- Internal business systems
- Commercial products
- Proprietary applications
- Company-wide automation or RAG/AI pipelines

It summarizes what is permitted, what is required, and what to be careful about when using exstruct in a corporate environment.

---

## 1. License of exstruct

**exstruct is released under the BSD-3-Clause License (Modified BSD License).**

The BSD-3-Clause license is a **very permissive open-source license**, allowing:

- commercial use
- modification
- redistribution
- integration into proprietary systems
- closed-source usage

There are **very few restrictions**, making it one of the most corporate-friendly licenses available.

---

## 2. What You ARE Allowed To Do (DO)

Thanks to the permissive nature of BSD-3-Clause, the following actions are explicitly allowed.

### Use in commercial or internal software

You may freely integrate exstruct into internal tools, production systems, or customer-facing products.

### Modify the library

You may adapt or change the code for internal purposes without releasing your modifications.

### Redistribute inside the company

Sharing the library with other teams, packaging it internally, or deploying it company-wide is allowed.

### Embed into proprietary or closed-source systems

No obligation to open your own code.

### In simple terms:

**You have maximum freedom to use exstruct within your organization.**

---

## 3. Required Compliance Points (MUST)

Although permissive, BSD-3-Clause includes three conditions you _must_ follow.

### (1) Preserve copyright notices

Include the original `LICENSE` file when redistributing the library.

### (2) Do not remove or alter the license text

The BSD license terms must remain intact in redistributed source or binary distributions.

### (3) Do not use the author's name for endorsement

You may not claim that the author endorses your product unless you obtain explicit permission.

---

## 4. What You MUST NOT Do (DON’T)

BSD-3-Clause prohibits only a small number of actions.

### Use the author's name for advertising

Example of a prohibited statement:

> “This system is officially approved by harumiWeb!”

### Distribute the library without the license

The LICENSE file must remain included.

---

## 5. License Compatibility of Dependencies

All dependencies of exstruct use **permissive licenses**, fully compatible with BSD-3-Clause.

| Dependency | License           | Compatibility                             |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| numpy      | BSD-3             | ◎ Fully compatible                        |
| pandas     | BSD-3             | ◎ Fully compatible                        |
| scipy      | BSD-3             | ◎ Fully compatible                        |
| xlwings    | BSD-3             | ◎ Fully compatible                        |
| openpyxl   | MIT               | ◎ Fully compatible                        |
| pydantic   | MIT               | ◎ Fully compatible                        |
| Pillow     | HPND / permissive | ◎ Fully compatible                        |
| pypdfium2  | Apache-2.0        | ◎ Compatible; no distribution obligations |
| dev tools  | MIT / Apache      | ◎ No issues                               |

➡ **No GPL, LGPL, MPL, or other copyleft licenses are present.**

This means there is **no risk of forced open-sourcing** or contamination of proprietary software.

---

## 6. Redistribution Inside the Company

When redistributing exstruct (or modified versions) inside your organization:

| Scenario                                       | Required Action                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Distributing exstruct unchanged                | Include `LICENSE`                                   |
| Distributing a modified version                | Include `LICENSE` (recommended: note modifications) |
| Packaging into executables (PyInstaller, etc.) | Include `LICENSE` somewhere in the distribution     |

Note: You do **not** need to include licenses of dependencies unless you redistribute their source code.

---

## 7. Conclusion: exstruct Is Highly Suitable for Corporate Use

Based on the license structure:

- exstruct is **safe for commercial use**
- All dependencies are fully **permissive**
- There is **zero copyleft risk**
- Internal redistribution is allowed
- Integration into proprietary systems is allowed

**exstruct is a corporate-friendly open-source component with very low compliance risk.**
