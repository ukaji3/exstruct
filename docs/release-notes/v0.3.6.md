# v0.3.6 Release Notes

This release improves rendering robustness for image export and large Excel
files, with better support for multi-page sheets and legacy .xls inputs.

## Highlights

- Sheet image export now renders all PDF pages per sheet, with `_pNN` suffixes
  for page 2+ (fixes multi-print-range sheets outputting only the first image).
- .xls rendering now uses Excel SaveAs to a temporary .xlsx before PDF export,
  avoiding failures when outputting images from legacy files.
- Image rendering can run in a subprocess to isolate memory usage and reduce
  crashes on large workbooks (enabled by default).

## Notes

- Set `EXSTRUCT_RENDER_SUBPROCESS=0` to disable subprocess rendering.
