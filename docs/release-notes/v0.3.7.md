# v0.3.7 Release Notes

This release adds formula extraction to the structured output, expanding the
pipeline, models, and backends while keeping the existing modes and fallbacks.

## Highlights

- Added `formulas_map` extraction (formula string -> cell coordinates) via
  openpyxl for .xlsx/.xlsm and COM for .xls, with `include_formulas_map` option
  and verbose default behavior.
- Pipeline, engine, and models now propagate `formulas_map` end-to-end, with
  updated samples and documentation.
- Rendering robustness improved for print-area exports (safer page numbering
  and error handling during PrintArea restoration).

## Notes

- `formulas_map` is emitted in `verbose` by default; use `include_formulas_map`
  to enable/disable explicitly.
