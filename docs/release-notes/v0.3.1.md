# v0.3.1 Release Notes

This release adds SmartArt extraction and updates shape modeling to better
separate standard shapes, arrows, and SmartArt structures.

## Highlights

- SmartArt extraction via Excel COM, including layout name and nested nodes.
- Shape modeling split into `Shape`, `Arrow`, and `SmartArt` for clearer semantics.
- SmartArt node payload optimized for compact output (`layout`, `nodes`, `kids`).

## Compatibility Notes

- `Shape.type` now exists only on `Shape`; it is omitted for `Arrow` and `SmartArt`.
- SmartArt output uses `layout` and `nodes` with `kids`; previous fields like
  `layout_name`, `roots`, or `children` are no longer present.
