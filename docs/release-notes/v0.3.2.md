# v0.3.2 Release Notes

This release adds merged cell range extraction and output controls, with
pipeline integration and tests to cover the new feature.

## Highlights

- `MergedCells` format and `SheetData.merged_cells` added to output.
- Merged cell ranges extracted via openpyxl in standard/verbose modes.
- Output can exclude merged cells via `OutputOptions.filters.include_merged_cells`.
- Pipeline/Backend/Modeling integrations updated with coverage for the new flow.

## Compatibility Notes

- Standard/verbose outputs now include `merged_cells` by default.
- Set `StructOptions.include_merged_cells=False` or
  `OutputOptions.filters.include_merged_cells=False` to suppress the field.
