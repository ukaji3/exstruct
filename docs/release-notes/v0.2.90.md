# v0.2.90 Release Notes

This release adds cell background color extraction via `colors_map`, including
conditional formatting support when running with Excel COM.

## Highlights

- `colors_map`: SheetData now includes background color locations keyed by hex
  color strings.
- COM display colors: in COM environments, extraction reads
  `DisplayFormat.Interior` to capture conditional formatting colors.
- ColorsOptions: configure color extraction with `include_default_background`
  and `ignore_colors` (normalized hex keys).
- Verbose mode: `mode="verbose"` now enables `colors_map` extraction by default.
- Tests: added coverage for default background exclusion and ignore lists.

## Compatibility Notes

- Non-COM environments still extract colors via openpyxl, without conditional
  formatting evaluation.
- `ignore_colors` is applied during extraction, reducing payload size early.
