# v0.2.80 Release Notes

This release improves shape extraction to better trace flowchart connections by
assigning per-sheet shape ids and linking connector endpoints.

## Highlights

- Shape ids: non-connector shapes now receive sequential `id` values per sheet
  to enable stable references.
- Connector linking: connector shapes capture `begin_id` and `end_id` resolved
  from connected shapes (via COM ConnectorFormat).
- Connector metadata: arrow styles, direction, and rotation are recorded for
  arrow/line connectors to enrich flow analysis.
- Schema updates: JSON schemas and the Shape model include the new connector
  fields.
- Samples and tests: added connector sample artifacts and expanded tests for
  connector extraction.

## Compatibility Notes

- Non-COM environments continue to omit connector details as before.
- Shape extraction now includes additional fields in the default output; existing
  fields and semantics remain unchanged.

## Thanks

- @moonmile for improving flowchart connectivity tracking (#15)
