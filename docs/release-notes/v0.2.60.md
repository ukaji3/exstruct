# v0.2.60 Release Notes

This is the first official release tag for ExStruct. It provides the core
capabilities for extracting structured data from Excel workbooks and supports
both the Python API and the CLI.

## Highlights

- Excel structured data: extract cells, table candidates, shapes, charts, print
  areas, auto page-break areas, and hyperlinks into JSON by default.
- Output modes: use `light` for non-COM environments (cells, tables, print
  areas) and `standard`/`verbose` when Excel COM is available for richer
  extraction including shapes, charts, sizes, and hyperlinks.
- Flexible formats: JSON by default, with optional YAML and TOON output.
  `--pretty` produces readable JSON for inspection.
- CLI rendering: when Excel is available, the CLI can export PDF and per-sheet
  PNG images.
- Graceful fallback: when Excel COM is unavailable, extraction falls back to
  cells and table candidates without crashing.

## Compatibility and Install

- Install via `pip install exstruct`.
- Optional extras: `exstruct[yaml]`, `exstruct[toon]`, `exstruct[render]`, or
  `exstruct[yaml,toon,render]`.
- Full extraction (shapes/charts) targets Windows + Excel via xlwings/COM.
  Use `mode=light` on other platforms.

## Other

- No breaking changes in this release.
- Issues and feedback are welcome.
