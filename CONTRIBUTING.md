# Contributing to ExStruct

Thank you for your interest in ExStruct.

ExStruct is primarily a **personal project**, developed and maintained by a single author in their private time.
While it is published as open source, its development direction and pace are intentionally kept personal and exploratory.

Please read the following carefully before opening an issue or pull request.

---

## Philosophy

ExStruct exists first and foremost as:

- a tool I personally need and use
- a place to explore Excel structure analysis deeply
- an evolving experiment rather than a product roadmap

Open source does **not** mean:

- fast responses
- guaranteed feature acceptance
- community-driven roadmap

Your understanding of this is greatly appreciated.

---

## Issues

Issues are welcome for:

- bug reports
- unexpected behavior
- conceptual questions
- discussion about Excel structure interpretation

However:

- Not all issues will be addressed
- Some issues may be closed without implementation
- Feature requests may be declined if they do not align with the project’s direction

If an issue is closed, it does **not** mean it is invalid or uninteresting.
It simply means it is outside the current scope or capacity.

---

## Pull Requests

Before submitting a pull request, please note:

- Large feature additions are **generally not accepted**
- Architectural changes require prior discussion via an issue
- Even well-written PRs may be declined

Reasons a PR may be declined include (but are not limited to):

- increased maintenance burden
- deviation from the project’s design philosophy
- impact on long-term extensibility
- lack of personal need or motivation to maintain it

This project values **long-term maintainability over short-term functionality**.

## What _Is_ Appreciated

The following contributions are always appreciated:

- bug reports with minimal reproducible examples
- documentation improvements
- clarifications of unclear behavior
- design discussions and alternative ideas (as discussion, not obligation)

Even if a contribution is not merged, thoughtful input is always welcome.

---

## Forking

Forking is fully encouraged.

If ExStruct does not fit your needs or priorities, creating and maintaining your own fork is a perfectly valid and respected option.
That is one of the strengths of open source.

---

## Response Time

Please understand that:

- responses may be slow
- development may pause for extended periods
- this project is maintained in spare time

There is no SLA, roadmap, or guaranteed support.

---

## Final Note

ExStruct is open source so that ideas, approaches, and experiments can be shared.
It is not intended to become a community-driven framework.

Thank you for respecting this boundary.
