# Todo

## 2026-03-19 v0.7.0 release closeout

### Planning

- [x] Add the `0.7.0` changelog entry with `Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed`.
- [x] Create `docs/release-notes/v0.7.0.md` for issue `#99` and maintainer-facing docs changes.
- [x] Add `v0.7.0` to the `Release Notes` nav in `mkdocs.yml`.
- [x] Align the local package version in `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` to `0.7.0`.
- [x] Move the legacy monkeypatch compatibility precedence note to `dev-docs/architecture/overview.md`.
- [x] Compress `tasks/feature_spec.md` and `tasks/todo.md` to a single release-closeout section.
- [x] Run `uv run task build-docs`.
- [x] Run `uv run task precommit-run`.
- [x] Run the release-prep `rg` and `git diff --check` consistency checks.

### Review

- `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/release-notes/v0.7.0.md`, `mkdocs.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, and `uv.lock` now describe and label the `0.7.0` release consistently.
- `dev-docs/architecture/overview.md` now holds the maintainer-facing note that compatibility shims must preserve live monkeypatch visibility and verify override precedence at the highest public entrypoint.
- Historical issue `#99`, PR follow-up, and prior cleanup logs were intentionally removed from `tasks/feature_spec.md` and `tasks/todo.md` after permanent information was classified and retained in `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/`, and `dev-docs/architecture/`.
- No new `dev-docs/specs/` or `dev-docs/adr/` migration was required for this closeout; `ADR-0006`, `ADR-0007`, and the editing specs remain the canonical permanent sources.
- Verification:
  - `uv run task build-docs`
  - `uv run task precommit-run`
  - `rg -n "0\.7\.0|v0\.7\.0" pyproject.toml uv.lock CHANGELOG.md mkdocs.yml docs/release-notes/v0.7.0.md`
  - `rg -n "^## " tasks/feature_spec.md tasks/todo.md`
  - `git diff --check -- CHANGELOG.md docs/release-notes/v0.7.0.md mkdocs.yml pyproject.toml uv.lock tasks/feature_spec.md tasks/todo.md dev-docs/architecture/overview.md`

## 2026-03-20 issue #107 extraction CLI startup optimization

### Planning

- [x] Confirm issue `#107` details with `gh issue view 107`.
- [x] Read current extraction CLI code, related docs/specs, and relevant tests.
- [x] Classify ADR need for the public CLI contract change.
- [x] Add the issue `#107` working spec to `tasks/feature_spec.md`.
- [x] Add or update the ADR for extraction CLI runtime capability validation.
- [x] Refactor extraction CLI parser construction so it never probes COM availability.
- [x] Always register `--auto-page-breaks-dir` in extraction CLI help.
- [x] Add runtime validation for `--auto-page-breaks-dir` covering `light` mode and unavailable COM on `standard` / `verbose`.
- [x] Keep existing `libreoffice` rejection and combined-error precedence intact.
- [x] Update extraction CLI tests for no-probe help and runtime validation.
- [x] Update current user docs and internal specs for the new CLI contract.
- [x] Run targeted pytest for extraction CLI coverage.
- [x] Run `uv run task build-docs`.
- [x] Run `uv run task precommit-run`.
- [x] Review task/spec retention and record permanent destinations in the Review section.

### Review

- Extraction CLI parser construction is now side-effect free: `build_parser()` always registers `--auto-page-breaks-dir`, and COM probing happens only when that flag is requested at runtime from a supported mode.
- `mode="light"` now fails explicitly for `--auto-page-breaks-dir`, while `mode="libreoffice"` keeps the existing core validation and combined-error precedence.
- Permanent destinations:
  - `dev-docs/adr/ADR-0008-extraction-cli-runtime-capability-validation.md` records the policy change and why parser-time probing is forbidden.
  - `docs/cli.md`, `README.md`, and `README.ja.md` now describe the always-visible flag and execution-time validation contract.
  - `dev-docs/specs/excel-extraction.md` now records the internal guarantee that the extraction CLI validates auto page-break export at runtime instead of parser construction.
- ADR checks:
  - `adr-linter`: no high/medium/low findings for `ADR-0008`.
  - `adr-reviewer`: `ready`, no findings.
  - `adr-reconciler`: no policy drift, no stale references, two low-evidence findings addressed by adding `verbose` and `main(["--help"])` regression tests.
  - `adr-indexer`: index artifacts were synchronized manually from the ADR source text (`README.md`, `index.yaml`, `decision-map.md`).
- Verification:
  - `gh issue view 107 --json number,title,body,labels,assignees,state,url`
  - `uv run pytest tests/cli/test_cli.py tests/cli/test_edit_cli.py -q`
  - `uv run task build-docs`
  - `uv run task precommit-run`
  - `git diff --check`

## 2026-03-20 issue #107 review follow-up: libreoffice auto page-break fast-fail

### Planning

- [x] Re-read the CLI review comment and compare it with `src/exstruct/cli/main.py` and the shared LibreOffice validator.
- [x] Update `tasks/feature_spec.md` with the follow-up contract and verification scope.
- [x] Make the CLI reject `--mode libreoffice --auto-page-breaks-dir` before `process_excel()`.
- [x] Preserve the existing combined LibreOffice error precedence when rendering flags are also present.
- [x] Add regression tests that prove the CLI rejects these requests before `process_excel()` runs.
- [x] Run targeted pytest for `tests/cli/test_cli.py`.
- [x] Update this Review section with the final validation result and retention decision.

### Review

- The review finding was valid: `_validate_auto_page_breaks_request()` treated `mode="light"` as a CLI-side fast-fail but let `mode="libreoffice"` fall through to the engine layer, which made responsibility and failure timing inconsistent.
- `src/exstruct/cli/main.py` now reuses `validate_libreoffice_process_request(...)` for `--auto-page-breaks-dir` in `mode="libreoffice"`, so the CLI rejects invalid requests before `process_excel()` while preserving the existing single-error and combined-error message precedence.
- `tests/cli/test_cli.py` now proves both `libreoffice + --auto-page-breaks-dir` and `libreoffice + --pdf + --auto-page-breaks-dir` fail before `process_excel()` runs, and that these paths do not probe COM availability.
- Retention decision:
  - No new permanent document was needed. This follow-up only brought the implementation back into alignment with the policy already recorded in `ADR-0008`, `docs/cli.md`, `README.md`, `README.ja.md`, and `dev-docs/specs/excel-extraction.md`.
  - The temporary working notes for this follow-up can stay limited to this section in `tasks/feature_spec.md` and `tasks/todo.md`.
- Verification:
  - `uv run pytest tests/cli/test_cli.py -q`
  - `uv run task precommit-run`
  - `git diff --check`

## 2026-03-20 issue #107 review follow-up: wording and help-text clarity

### Planning

- [x] Retrieve the PR review comments with `gh` and classify which findings are substantive.
- [x] Confirm the wording nits in `tasks/todo.md` and `dev-docs/adr/ADR-0008-extraction-cli-runtime-capability-validation.md`.
- [x] Clarify the `--auto-page-breaks-dir` help text in `src/exstruct/cli/main.py` so it matches the runtime contract.
- [x] Update CLI help tests for the clarified wording.
- [x] Run targeted pytest for `tests/cli/test_cli.py`.
- [x] Run `uv run task precommit-run`.
- [x] Record the review outcome and retention decision here.

### Review

- The explicit PR review findings were valid but minor: `tasks/todo.md` and `dev-docs/adr/ADR-0008-extraction-cli-runtime-capability-validation.md` each had a hyphenation nit (`low-evidence`, `side-effect-free`).
- A separate suppressed Copilot note about `--auto-page-breaks-dir` help text was also substantively valid: the old string mentioned only LibreOffice rejection and omitted that output files follow `--format`, while the actual runtime contract also rejects `light` and requires `standard`/`verbose` with Excel COM.
- `src/exstruct/cli/main.py` now states the fuller contract in the argument help text, and `tests/cli/test_cli.py` now checks for the clarified help wording without depending on exact `argparse` line wrapping.
- Retention decision:
  - No new ADR or spec migration was needed. The durable contract remains in `ADR-0008`, `docs/cli.md`, and the README files; this follow-up only aligns wording and help text with that existing policy.
  - The temporary working record can stay limited to this section in `tasks/feature_spec.md` and `tasks/todo.md`.
- Verification:
  - `gh pr view 111 --json number,title,reviewDecision,reviews,comments,files,url`
  - `gh api repos/harumiWeb/exstruct/pulls/111/comments`
  - `uv run pytest tests/cli/test_cli.py -q`
  - `uv run task precommit-run`
  - `git diff --check`
