- [EXP-02] JSON output is UTF-8
- [EXP-03] YAML output uses sort_keys=False
- [EXP-04] TOON output is generated correctly

- [EXP-15] When include_print_areas=False, do not output even if `print_areas_dir` is set
- [EXP-16] PrintAreaView includes only shapes/charts intersecting the range, and treats shapes with unknown size as points
- [EXP-17] Chart.w/h are output in verbose; in standard they are controlled by `include_chart_size`
- [EXP-18] Shape.w/h are controlled by `include_shape_size`; the default True applies only in verbose

# 5. CLI Requirements

- [CLI-01] `exstruct extract file.xlsx` succeeds
- [CLI-02] `--format json/yaml/toon` works
- [CLI-03] `--image` outputs PNG (Excel COM required, disallowed in `mode=libreoffice`)

- [ERR-02] Preserve other elements even when shape extraction fails
- [ERR-03] On chart extraction failure, record it in Chart.error
- [ERR-04] Do not raise an exception for broken reference ranges; record null/error
- [ERR-05] Output a message and exit when the Excel file cannot be opened

- [REG-02] Detect model key deletion / renaming as breaking changes
- [REG-03] Detect changes to the direction estimation algorithm
- [REG-04] ChartSeries reference parsing matches past results

---

# 8. Non-functional Requirements

- Performance / memory targets will be added when separately defined

---

# 9. Mode / Integration Requirements

- [MODE-01] CLI `--mode` / API `extract(..., mode=)` accepts light/libreoffice/standard/verbose (default: standard)
- [MODE-02] light: cells + tables only, shapes/charts empty, no COM
- [MODE-03] standard: existing behavior (text-bearing shapes / arrows, and charts if COM is enabled)
- [MODE-04] verbose: all shapes (with size) and charts (with size, except for specific exclusions)
- [MODE-05] process_excel propagates mode when combined with PDF/image options
- [MODE-05a] `process_excel(..., mode="libreoffice")` rejects `pdf` / `image` / `auto_page_breaks_dir` early with `ConfigError`
- [MODE-05b] For `mode="libreoffice"` Python runtime detection, success of the bundled bridge `--probe` is the acceptance condition; incompatible `EXSTRUCT_LIBREOFFICE_PYTHON_PATH` settings are handled early as unavailable/incompatible errors
- [MODE-05c] The required Linux smoke job in GitHub Actions runs `pytest.mark.libreoffice` smoke without skip on `ubuntu-24.04` + `libreoffice` + `python3-uno`
- [MODE-05d] The Windows smoke job in GitHub Actions uses `windows-2025` + `libreoffice-fresh`, prioritizes `soffice.com` for `EXSTRUCT_LIBREOFFICE_PATH` (fallback to `soffice.exe` if not present), and runs `pytest.mark.libreoffice` smoke without skip
- [MODE-06] In standard, existing fixtures do not regress and unnecessary shapes do not increase
- [MODE-07] An invalid mode errors before processing starts
- [INT-01] On COM open failure, fall back to cells + table_candidates
- [INT-02] Preserve print_areas even during COM fallback
- [IO-05] `dict_without_empty_values` removes None/empty list/empty dict and preserves nesting
- [RENDER-01] PDF/PNG smoke tests for Excel+COM+pypdfium2 (env ON/OFF)
- [MODE-08] In light, extract print_areas with openpyxl and exclude them from default output (automatic determination)

## 9.1 Pipeline

- [PIPE-01] build_pre_com_pipeline includes only the required steps according to include_* and mode
- [PIPE-02] build_cells_tables_workbook reflects print_areas conditionally and preserves table_candidates
- [PIPE-03] resolve_extraction_inputs resolves include_* using mode defaults
- [PIPE-04] run_extraction_pipeline attempts COM and falls back to cells+tables on failure
- [PIPE-05] colors_map is overwritten with COM results when COM succeeds, and openpyxl is used only on failure
- [PIPE-06] print_areas preserves openpyxl results, and COM supplements only missing parts
- [PIPE-07] PipelineState holds com_attempted/com_succeeded/fallback_reason
- [PIPE-08] Do not include the COM step for auto_page_breaks when include_auto_page_breaks=False
- [PIPE-09] Do not include the extraction step for merged_cells when include_merged_cells=False
- [PIPE-MOD-01] build_workbook_data builds WorkbookData/SheetData from raw containers
- [PIPE-MOD-02] collect_sheet_raw_data collects extracted data into raw containers

## 9.2 Backend

- [BE-01] OpenpyxlBackend switches cell extraction paths depending on whether include_links is enabled
- [BE-02] OpenpyxlBackend continues with an empty list when table detection fails
- [BE-03] ComBackend returns None when colors_map extraction fails
- [BE-04] OpenpyxlBackend returns None when colors_map extraction fails
- [BE-05] ComBackend continues with an empty map when print_areas extraction fails
- [BE-06] OpenpyxlBackend continues with an empty map when merged_cells extraction fails
- [BE-07] Unimplemented merged_cells in ComBackend raises NotImplementedError

## 9.3 Ranges

- [RNG-01] parse_range_zero_based can normalize sheet-qualified ranges such as "Sheet1!A1:B2"

## 9.4 Table Detection

- [TBL-01] Rectangular merging does not consolidate rectangles in a containment relationship
- [TBL-02] Can generate table candidate range strings from a value matrix

## 9.5 Workbook

- [WB-01] openpyxl_workbook calls close regardless of whether an exception occurs
- [WB-02] openpyxl_workbook sets filters to suppress known openpyxl warnings
- [WB-03] _find_open_workbook tolerates fullname/resolve exceptions and returns None
- [WB-04] _find_open_workbook returns None on a top-level exception
- [WB-05] xlwings_workbook does not start App if an existing workbook is found

## 9.6 Logging

- [LOG-01] log_fallback outputs a warning log including the reason code

## 9.7 Integration/E2E

- [E2E-01] The full flow light extraction → serialize_workbook → export_sheets succeeds
- [E2E-02] Engine.process can output JSON to a stream when output_path=None

# 10. COM Test Operations (Local Manual)

Because CI cannot run Excel COM, COM tests are run manually on local environments.
In Codecov, unit and com are separated, and com is maintained with carryforward.

## 10.1 Local execution procedure

- unit (CI equivalent): `task test-unit`
- COM: `task test-com`
- LibreOffice smoke (Linux/Windows CI equivalent): `RUN_LIBREOFFICE_SMOKE=1 pytest tests/core/test_libreoffice_smoke.py -m libreoffice -q`

## 10.2 Codecov manual upload (optional)

Set `CODECOV_TOKEN` and `CODECOV_SHA` for manual upload.

- unit upload: `codecov-cli upload-process -f coverage.xml -F unit -C %CODECOV_SHA% -t %CODECOV_TOKEN%`
- COM upload: `codecov-cli upload-process -f coverage.xml -F com -C %CODECOV_SHA% -t %CODECOV_TOKEN%`
