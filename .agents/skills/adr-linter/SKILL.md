# ADR Linter

Review the ADR as a decision record, not as prose polish.

## Read

1. `dev-docs/agents/adr-governance.md`
2. `dev-docs/agents/adr-workflow.md`
3. `dev-docs/adr/template.md`
4. Related ADRs if the draft mentions supersede or overlap

## Workflow

1. Validate the status value.
2. Check that the ADR has `状態`, `背景`, `決定`, `影響`, `根拠`, `Supersedes`, and `Superseded by`.
3. Verify that `根拠` contains concrete `Tests`, `Code`, or `Related specs`.
4. Check that consequences include tradeoffs, not only benefits.
5. If supersede or replacement is claimed, verify the referenced ADR links are present and consistent.

## Output Contract

Return findings first, ordered by severity.

- `high`: contract hole, missing decision, invalid status, missing supersede linkage
- `medium`: weak context, weak evidence, one-sided consequences
- `low`: clarity or consistency issues

If no findings exist, say that explicitly and mention any residual review risk.
